His book examines how the ever-changing role of colour in society has been reflected in manuscripts, stained
glass, clothing, painting and popular culture. Colour is a natural phenomenon, of course, but it is also a complex
cultural construct that resists generalization and, indeed, analysis itself. No doubt this is why serious works
devoted to colour are rare, and rarer still are those that aim to study it in historical context. Many authors search
for the universal or archetypal truths they imagine reside in colour, but for the historian, such truths do not exist.
Colour is first and foremost a social phenomenon. There is no transcultural truth to colour perception, despite
what many books based on poorly grasped neurobiology or – even worse – on pseudoesoteric pop psychology
would have us believe. Such books unfortunately clutter the bibliography on the subject, and even do it harm.
The silence of historians on the subject of colour, or more particularly their difficulty in conceiving colour as a
subject separate from other historical phenomena, is the result of three different sets of problems. The first
concerns documentation and preservation. We see the colours transmitted to us by the past as time has altered
them and not as they were originally. Moreover, we see them under light conditions that often are entirely
different from those known by past societies. And finally, over the decades we have developed the habit of
looking at objects from the past in black-and-white photographs and, despite the current diffusion of colour
photography, our ways of thinking about and reacting to these objects seem to have remained more or less black
and white.
The second set of problems concerns methodology. As soon as the historian seeks to study colour, he must
grapple with a host of factors all at once: physics, chemistry, materials, and techniques of production, as well as
iconography, ideology, and the symbolic meanings that colours convey. How to make sense of all of these
elements? How can one establish an analytical model facilitating the study of images and coloured objects? No
researcher, no method, has yet been able to resolve these problems, because among the numerous facts
pertaining to colour, a researcher tends to select those facts that support his study and to conveniently forget
those that contradict it. This is clearly a poor way to conduct research. And it is made worse by the temptation
to apply to the objects and images of a given historical period information found in texts of that period. The
proper method – at least in the first phase of analysis – is to proceed as do palaeontologists (who must study
cave paintings without the aid of texts): by extrapolating from the images and the objects themselves a logic and
a system based on various concrete factors such as the rate of occurrence of particular objects and motifs, their
distribution and disposition. In short, one undertakes the internal structural analysis with which any study of an
image or coloured object should begin.
The third set of problems is philosophical: it is wrong to project our own conceptions and definitions of colour
onto the images, objects and monuments of past centuries. Our judgements and values are not those of previous
societies (and no doubt they will change again in the future). For the writer-historian looking at the definitions
and taxonomy of colour, the danger of anachronism is very real. For example, the spectrum with its natural
order of colours was unknown before the seventeenth century, while the notion of primary and secondary
colours did not become common until the nineteenth century. These are not eternal notions but stages in the
ever-changing history of knowledge.
I have reflected on such issues at greater length in my previous work, so while the present book does address
certain of them, for the most part it is devoted to other topics. Nor is it concerned only with the history of colour
in images and artworks – in any case that area still has many gaps to be filled. Rather, the aim of this book is to
examine all kinds of objects in order to consider the different facets of the history of colour and to show how far
beyond the artistic sphere this history reaches. The history of painting is one thing; that of colour is another,
much larger, question. Most studies devoted to the history of colour err in considering only the pictorial, artistic
or scientific realms. But the lessons to be learned from colour and its real interest lie elsewhere.

Amy normally hated Monday mornings, but this year was different. Kamal was in her art class and she liked Kamal. She was waiting outside the classroom when her friend Tara arrived.

“Hi Amy! Your mum sent me a text. You forgot your inhaler. Why don’t you turn your phone on?” Amy didn’t like technology. She never sent text messages and she hated Facebook too.

“Did Kamal ask you to the disco?” Tara was Amy’s best friend, and she wanted to know everything that was happening in Amy’s life. “I don’t think he likes me,” said Amy. “And I never see him alone. He’s always with Grant.” Amy and Tara didn’t like Grant.

“Do you know about their art project?” asked Amy. “It’s about graffiti, I think,” said Tara. “They’re working on it at the old house behind the factory.” “But that building is dangerous,” said Amy. “Aah, are you worried he’s going to get hurt?"

A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee  =  Positive

As many countries urge populations to stay at home, many of us are paying more attention to our diets and how the food we eat can support our health. To help sort out the fact from the fiction, BBC Future is updating some of our most popular nutrition stories from our archive.
Our colleagues at BBC Good Food are focusing on practical solutions for ingredient swaps, nutritious storecupboard recipes and all aspects of cooking and eating during lockdown.
As many of us find ourselves confined to our houses due to social isolation measures, concerns tend to arise about the lack of sunlight – and possible vitamin D deficiency. For many, a go-to fix is to take supplements.
The supplement, after all, has been touted as a near-miracle. Both vitamin D2 and D3 supplements are available over-the-counter without a prescription and have been linked to improving immunity, tiredness and muscle weakness, bone pain, and depression. They’ve also been said to help stave off cancer and the consequences of ageing.
It may be little wonder that, according to research by market analysis company Mintel, a third of adults in the UK who take vitamin supplements count vitamin D among them.  =  Positive

This movie is... horrible and wonderful at the same time. I first saw it when I was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me. In this movie, Cesar Romero actually plays the character of Octavio, the man who discovered Santana. There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (plays Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (plays the priest), who have large filmographies, and these are the only performances that are okay. The rest of the acting and the movie itself have all of the B-film qualities that some of us cherish.I recently spent 2 years trying to acquire a copy of this movie, and it is almost nonexistent. I am assuming that it was discontinued very shortly after its release. But I did eventually find a copy and paid a pretty penny to acquire it. If you happen to come upon Judgement Day in a video store (unmistakeable with a cheesy green satan on the cover), count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still has a working copy. A must see for those of you who like to laugh at cheesy attempts at a scary movie.  =  Positive

Around the world, humans are struggling to ignore thousands of years of bio-social convention and avoid touching another. Shaking hands might be one of the hardest customs to lose in the post-pandemic world but there are alternatives, writes James Jeffrey.

The humble handshake spans the mundane to the potent, ranging from a simple greeting between strangers who will never meet again, to the sealing of billion-dollar deals between business titans.

There are various ideas about the origin of the handshake. It may have originated in ancient Greece as a symbol of peace between two people by showing that neither person was carrying a weapon. Or the shaking gesture of the handshake may have started in Medieval Europe, when knights would shake the hand of others in an attempt to shake loose any hidden weapons.

The Quakers are credited with popularising the handshake after they deemed it to be more egalitarian than bowing.

The handshake is a “literal gesture of human connectedness,“ a symbol of how humans have evolved to be deeply social, tactile-orientated animals, says Cristine Legare, a psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

With a history tracing back thousands of years, the handshake may be too entrenched to be easily halted.

“The fact we went for the elbow bump as an alternative shows how important touch is - we didn't want to lose that physical connecting,“ says Prof Legare.

That biological drive to touch and be touched is found in other animals as well. In the 1960s American psychologist Harry Harlow demonstrated how vital touch and affection was for the development of young rhesus monkeys.

Why going without physical touch is so hard
Other examples from the animal kingdom include our closest cousins: chimpanzees typically touch palms, hug and sometimes kiss as a form of greeting. Giraffes use their necks that can reach two metres in length to engage in a type of behaviour called “necking“ - with male giraffes entwining their neck with each other's and swaying and rubbing to assess the other's strength and size to establish dominance.

That said, numerous forms of human greeting exist around the world that avoid the transmission trap. Many cultures embrace pressing the palms of hands together with fingers pointing up while accompanied by a slight bow, the traditional Hindu Namaste greeting being one of the most well-known.  =  Positive

Short Moral Stories - Having A Best Friend

A story tells that two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the journey they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face.

The one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand;

“Today my best friend slapped me in the face.”

They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him. After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone;

“Today my best friend saved my life.”

The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him;

“After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now, you write on a stone, why?”

The other friend replied;

“When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it.”

Moral of the story: 
Don’t value the things you have in your life. But value who you have in your life.  =  Positive

Humans need a reasonably accurate view of the world in order to survive. If your model of reality is wildly different from the actual world, then you struggle to take effective actions each day. 

However, truth and accuracy are not the only things that matter to the human mind. Humans also seem to have a deep desire to belong.

In Atomic Habits, I wrote, “Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a death sentence.”

Understanding the truth of a situation is important, but so is remaining part of a tribe. While these two desires often work well together, they occasionally come into conflict.

In many circumstances, social connection is actually more helpful to your daily life than understanding the truth of a particular fact or idea. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker put it this way, “People are embraced or condemned according to their beliefs, so one function of the mind may be to hold beliefs that bring the belief-holder the greatest number of allies, protectors, or disciples, rather than beliefs that are most likely to be true.” 

We don't always believe things because they are correct. Sometimes we believe things because they make us look good to the people we care about.

I thought Kevin Simler put it well when he wrote, “If a brain anticipates that it will be rewarded for adopting a particular belief, it's perfectly happy to do so, and doesn't much care where the reward comes from — whether it's pragmatic (better outcomes resulting from better decisions), social (better treatment from one's peers), or some mix of the two.” 

False beliefs can be useful in a social sense even if they are not useful in a factual sense. For lack of a better phrase, we might call this approach “factually false, but socially accurate.”  When we have to choose between the two, people often select friends and family over facts.

This insight not only explains why we might hold our tongue at a dinner party or look the other way when our parents say something offensive, but also reveals a better way to change the minds of others.  =  Positive

It doesn't take long to figure out if something is worth reading. Skilled writing and high-quality ideas stick out.
As a result, most people should probably start more books than they do. This doesn't mean you need to read each book page-by-page. You can skim the table of contents, chapter titles, and subheadings. Pick an interesting section and dive in for a few pages. Maybe flip through the book and glance at any bolded points or tables. In ten minutes, you'll have a reasonable idea of how good it is.
Then comes the crucial step: Quit books quickly and without guilt or shame.
Life is too short to waste it on average books. The opportunity cost is too high. There are so many amazing things to read. I think Patrick Collison, the founder of Stripe, put it nicely when he said, “Life is too short to not read the very best book you know of right now.”
Here's my recommendation: Start more books. Quit most of them. Read the great ones twice.  =  Positive

Constraints actually increase our skill development rather than restrict it. We need lines to show us where to add color, not a blank canvas to draw on. As an entrepreneur, I struggled to manage myself until I realized that I needed to add some structure to my day. I began to only schedule calls in the afternoon. I blocked my email inbox until noon. I required myself to publish a new article every Monday and Thursday. By adding a few carefully designed constraints to my life I reduced my freedom, but actually improved my productivity and happiness. Instead of feeling restricted by constraints, I felt empowered.Degrees can be important. (I don't want to be operated on by a neurosurgeon who didn't attend medical school.) But as my friend Charlie Gilkey told me, “Most people need degrees because they don't have the courage to ask for what they want.” In many cases, the courage to ask for what you want and a willingness to solve other people's problems is all you really need. The degrees, the awards, going to the “right” school or being born into the “right” family—none of these things are a prerequisite for success.  =  Positive

I usually have a tough time with chick flicks, and it was with great chagrin that I learned that the Friday rental of the house would be Eat Pray Love starring (arguably the chick flick queen) Julia Roberts. I thought I would hate it, I expected to see a sappy tear-jerker with Roberts playing her usual character.

Exactly what I got. Roberts almost cruelly and certainly suddenly/without warning leaves her husband (Billy Crudup) to travel the world, visiting Rome to Eat, India to Pray, and Bali to Love. During her adventures she meets Javier Bardem, Richard Jenkins, and many others.

Won't lie, I enjoyed quite a bit of this. A lot of the film is Julia Roberts being Julia Roberts, treading no new ground and playing her usual boring role. But, I suppose, that was the point. The character she plays is boring and normal, and even when she travels across the world Roberts does little to show the changes her character experiences. Can't say I really liked her character, which provided a bizarre feeling for the entirety of the movie. Was I supposed to root for Julia? Who knows.

EPL has some remarkable cinematography that deserves noting. I was surprised it wasn't nodded towards at the Oscars this year; shots of all these countries are beautifully represented. The script lags the most in Rome, but really picks up in India and Bali. As I said, Roberts is an unsympathetic character, but each travel experience brings interesting characters. Richard Jenkins, undoubtedly the most underrated actors ever, shines in his role of Richard from Texas in India. Bardem is good as well, but that's not a surprise. These two are the bright spots here.

If you've seen the trailer you've seen the movie, but if you're not looking for that much I think you'll be as surprised as I was. Worth it for the cinematography and characters. Plus, for that Friday-night chick flick your girlfriend picks out, you could do worse.  =  Positive

Even people who experienced mild symptoms of Covid-19 could still have acquired immunity for several weeks or more, according to a new study in French healthcare workers. The news is promising as it suggests mild Covid-19 cases might hold some protection against re-infection, but it’s worth remembering that immunity can be a very fiddly and fickle thing, especially when it comes to this new and little understood virus.

Researchers from Strasbourg University Hospital and the Pasteur Institute studied 160 French healthcare workers who contracted Covid-19, but only experienced mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization. Blood samples revealed that almost all of the patients developed antibodies to Covid-19 within 15 days of the infection, while up to 98 percent of them still had neutralizing antibodies after 28 days. 

The neutralizing activity of antibodies also appeared to increase over time, with neutralizing antibodies detected in 79 percent of samples 13-20 days after the onset of symptoms, and then in 92 percent of samples after 21-27 days, followed by 98 percent after 28-41 days.

“It was known that people with severe forms of the disease developed antibodies within 15 days of the onset of the signs. We now know that this is also true for those who have minor forms, even if the antibody levels are probably lower,” Arnaud Fontanet, one of the authors of the study and head of the Global Health department at the Institute Pastor, said in a statement. 

The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was recently released by the researchers and available to read on the pre-print server MedRxiv.

The researchers say their findings suggest people who have been infected with Covid-19, even if they experienced only mild symptoms, have protection against reinfection of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, for “at least up to 40 days after the onset of signs.” However, it remains unclear whether this protection lasts for longer. 

Immunity to any virus isn't simply black-and-white, but rather a spectrum – one can experience a continuum of infection levels from zero to full infection and everything in between. Even if you have antibodies to a specific virus, it doesn’t necessarily mean you are totally protected from the infection. Equally, levels of immunity can progressively slip as time goes on. Furthermore, immunity is not all about antibodies; the immune response to a pathogen also relies on a well-trained army of B cells (the white blood cell that secretes antibodies) and T-cells (which directly kill cells that have been infected by an invader).

This new research looks promising but is not a guarantee that people who have had a mild Covid-19 infection will have any lengthy, meaningful immunity to reinfection. The team is hoping to investigate this further by looking at the patients’ antibody response and its associated neutralization capacity in the long term.

“Yes, we have good results for a month but we have no way of predicting how long this will last,” Kevin Ariën, professor of virology at the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp, who was not directly involved in this study, told the Financial Times. “We presume that people infected in this first wave of Covid-19 will be protected if there’s a second wave in the autumn, but we don’t really know what will happen.”
