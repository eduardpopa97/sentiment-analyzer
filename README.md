# sentiment-analyzer

This application made use of Machine Learning techniques in order to determine the general sentiment of
comments from social media (positive, negative or neutral). The user can introduce content by writing or
copying a text in a textbox, by a link, by a file or by selecting Twitter content by subject. The processed
results will be displayed in a manner that will allow the user to distinguish different algorithmâ€™s results
(Bayes, Dictionary Based Approach). As programming tools I have used PHP for the backend server (running on XAMPP)
and Machine Learning scripts.
